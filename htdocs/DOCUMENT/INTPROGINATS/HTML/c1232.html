> I have given a presentation of the core of ATS in this part of
book. While this core is largely similar to the core of the functional
language ML (and various other call-by-value functional languages), there
are also crucial differences. I list some of these differences as follows:

<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
> ATS shares the same native data representation with the C
programming language.  This differs profoundly from ML and most other
functional languages, which all rely on some forms of boxed data
representation. In ATS, there are native/flat/unboxed tuples and records as
well as boxed ones.  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
> ATS supports both envless functions and closure functions
while ML and most other functional languages only support the latter. In
ATS, envless functions and closure functions can be differentiated at the
level of types.  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
> In ATS, there are both function templates and polymorphic
functions. The need for the former primarily stems from the support for
native data representation.  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;ATS provides explicit support for mutually recursive tail-call optimization.
</P
></LI
></UL
>

Except for making use of a few printing functions, I have intentionally
stayed away from programming features that can generate effects when
presenting the core of ATS. I will cover such programming features when
addressing in the next part of the book the issue of supporting practical
programming in ATS.
