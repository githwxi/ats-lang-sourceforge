Installation Guide for ATS/Geizella

The current implementation of ATS is given the name ATS/Geizella or
simply Geizella. It is written in Objective Caml. In order to install
Geizella, the following requirements need to be met:

  * OS requirement: Linux. We have so far only tested Geizella under
Linux, and we plan to port it to other platforms in the future.
  * PL requirements: ocaml (version 3.08 or later) and gcc.

Also, the library [libgmp.a] is needed.

Once these requirements are met, you can readily install Geizella in 3
steps as describled below:

Step 1: After downloading the tarball ATS.tar.gz, please untar it in a
directory, say "FOO/", of your choice. This, for instance, can be done
by executing the following command:

tar -zvxf ATS.tar.gz 

All the files and directories extracted from the tarball are now in
the directory "FOO/ATS/".

Step 2: Please set the shell environmental variable ATSHOME to be
"FOO/ATS/". For instance, if you use CSH (or TCSH), this can be done
by executing the following command:

setenv ATSHOME FOO/ATS/

You also need to put the directory "FOO/ATS/bin/" in your execution
path. This can be done in CSH (or TCSH) as follows:

setenv PATH ${PATH}:${ATSHOME}/bin

You may want to put these commands in a file (e.g., .cshrc) that is
executed each time a shell is started.

Step 3: You can now go into the directory "FOO/ATS/" and execute

make all

This generates an executable "atscc" in the directory "FOO/ATS/bin/",
which is the command you need for compiling ATS programs. Also, this
generates a library file "libats.a" in the directory
"FOO/ATS/CCOMP/lib/".
