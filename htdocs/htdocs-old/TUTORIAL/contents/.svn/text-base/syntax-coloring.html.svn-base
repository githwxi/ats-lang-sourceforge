<HR SIZE=1 ALIGN=LEFT><P>

ATS is a rich language with a highly expressive type systm, and the syntax
of ATS can be a daunting obstacle for beginners trying to understand
ATS code. In order to alleviate this problem, we may employ colors to
differentiate various syntatical components in a program written in ATS.
The convention for coloring ATS syntax is summarized as follows:

<UL>

<LI>
The keywords in ATS are all colored <FONT COLOR="#000000">black</FONT>.

<LI>
The comments in ATS are all colored <FONT COLOR="#787878">gray</FONT>.

<LI>
The code in the statics of ATS is colored <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">blue</FONT>.

<LI>
The code in the dynamics of ATS is colored <FONT COLOR="#E80000">red</FONT>
unless it represents proofs, for which the <FONT
COLOR="#009000">dark green</FONT> color is used.

<LI>
The external code (in C) is colored <FONT COLOR="#A52A2A">deep brown</FONT>.

</UL>
