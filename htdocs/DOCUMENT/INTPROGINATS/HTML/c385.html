>Functions play a foundational role in programming.  While it may be
theoretically possible to program without functions (but with loops), such
a programming style is of little practical value. ATS does provide some
language constructs for implementing for-loops and while-loops directly. I,
however, strongly recommend that the programmer implement loops as
recursive functions or more precisely, as tail-recursive functions. This is
a programming style that matches well with more advanced programming
features in ATS that will be presented in this book later.

>Given an expression exp of the type <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>double</FONT
>, we can
multiply exp by itself to compute its square. If exp is a complex
expression, we may introduce a binding between a name and exp so that exp
is only evaluated once. This idea is shown in the following example:

<DIV
CLASS="informalexample"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN394"
></A
><TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"

><TD
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>let val x = 3.14 * (10.0 - 1.0 / 1.4142) in x * x end
</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
></P
></DIV
>

Now suppose that we have found a more efficient way to do squaring. In
order to take full advantage of it, we need to modify each occurrence of
squaring in the current program accordingly. This style of programming is
clearly not modular, and it is of little chance to scale. To address this
problem, we can implement a function as follows to compute the square of a
given floating point number:

<DIV
CLASS="informalexample"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN396"
></A
><TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>fn square (x: double): double = x * x
</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
></P
></DIV
>

The keyword <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>fn</FONT
> initiates the definition of a non-recursive
function, and the name following it is for the function to be defined.  In
the above example, the function <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>square</FONT
> takes one argument of
the name <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>x</FONT
>, which is assumed to have the type
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>double</FONT
>, and returns a value of the type
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>double</FONT
>. The expression on the right-hand side (RHS) of the
symbol <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>=</FONT
> is the body of the function, which is <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>x *
x</FONT
> in this case. If we have a more efficient way to do squaring, we
can just re-implement the body of the function <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>square</FONT
>
accordingly to take advantage of it, and there is no other changes needed
(assuming that squaring is solely done by calling <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>square</FONT
>).
</P
><P
>If <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>square</FONT
> is a name, what is the expression it refers to? It
turns out that the above function definition can also be written as follows:

<DIV
CLASS="informalexample"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN409"
></A
><TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>val square = lam (x: double): double =&#62; x * x
</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
></P
></DIV
>

where the RHS of the symbol <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>=</FONT
> is a lambda-expression
representing an anonymous function that takes one argument of the type
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>double</FONT
> and returns a value of the type <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>double</FONT
>,
and the expression following the symbol <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>=&#62;</FONT
> is the body of the
function. If we wish, we can change the name of the function argument as
follows:

<DIV
CLASS="informalexample"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN415"
></A
><TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>val square = lam (y: double): double =&#62; y * y
</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
></P
></DIV
>

This is called alpha-renaming (of function arguments), and the new
lambda-expression is said to be alpha-equivalent to the original one.
</P
><P
>A lambda-expression is a (function) value. Suppose we have a
lambda-expression representing a binary function, that is, a function
taking two arguments. In order to assign a type of the form (T1, T2) -&#62; T
to the lambda-expression, we need to verify that the body of the function
can be given the type T if the two arguments of the function are assumed to
have the types T1 and T2.  What is stated also applies, <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>mutatis
mutandis</I
>, to lambda-expressions representing functions of fewer
or more arguments. For instance, the lambda-expression <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>lam (x:
double): double =&#62; x * x</FONT
> can be assigned the function type
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>(double) -&#62; double</FONT
>, which may also be written as <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>double
-&#62; double</FONT
>.
</P
><P
>Assume that exp is an expression of some function type (T1, T2) -&#62;
T. Note that exp is not necessarily a name or a lambda-expression. If
expressions exp<SUB
>1</SUB
> and exp<SUB
>2</SUB
> can
be assigned the types T1 and T2, then the function application
exp(exp<SUB
>1</SUB
>, exp<SUB
>2</SUB
>), which may
also be referred to as a function call, can be assigned the type T.  Typing
a function application of fewer or more arguments is handled similarly.
</P
><P
>Let us now see an example that builds on the previously defined
function <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>square</FONT
>. The boundary of a ring consists of two
circles centered at the same point. If the radii of the outer and inner
circles are R and r, respectively, then the area of the ring can be
computed by the following function <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>area_of_ring</FONT
>:

<DIV
CLASS="informalexample"
><P
></P
><A
NAME="AEN430"
></A
><TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>fn area_of_ring
  (R: double, r: double): double = 3.1416 * (square(R) - square(r))
// end of [area_of_ring]
</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
></P
></DIV
>

Given that the subtraction and multiplication functions (on floating point
numbers) are of the type <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>(double, double) -&#62; double</FONT
> and
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>square</FONT
> is of the type <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>(double) -&#62; double</FONT
>, it is a
simple routine to verify that the body of <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>area_of_ring</FONT
> can be
assigned the type <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>double</FONT
>.
