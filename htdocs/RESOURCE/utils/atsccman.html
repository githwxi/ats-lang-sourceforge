<p>
The command <strong>atscc</strong> is a wrapper for convenience around the
ATS-compilation command <strong>atsopt</strong>. Sometimes, it is also given the
name <strong>patscc</strong>. In a given command-line starting with
<strong>atscc</strong>, each file containing ATS code is first to be replaced
with a corresponding file containing the C code generated by
<strong>atsopt</strong> from compiling the ATS code. A new command-line is then
formed by replacing <strong>atscc</strong> with a C-compilation command (such as
gcc and clang) and subsequently executed to compile the files containing
the generated C code.

<h2>Environment Variables</h2>

<menu>
<li>
<u>ATSOPT</u>:
If set, this variable should store the name of the ATS-compilation command.
If not set, then the default name <i>atsopt</i> is assumed.

<li>
<u>ATSCCOMP</u>:
If set, this variable should store the name of the C-compilation command.
If not set, then the following default name is assumed:

<pre>gcc -D_XOPEN_SOURCE -I${ATSHOME} -I${ATSHOME}/ccomp/runtime -L${ATSHOME}/ccomp/atslib/lib
</pre>

<h2>Option-controlling Flags</h2>

<menu>
<li>
<u>-h</u>:
This flag is a short form of <u>--help</u>.

<li>
<u>--help</u>:
This flag is for inquiring usage information on <strong>atscc</strong>.

<li>
<u>-hats</u>:
This flag is for inquiring usage information on <strong>atsopt</strong>.

<li>
<u>-vats</u>:
This flag is for inquiring version information on <strong>atsopt</strong>.

<li>
<u>-ccats</u>:
This flag indicates that <strong>atscc</strong> is only required to compile
files containing ATS code into corresponding files containing C code and it
should not attempt to compile the generated C code.

<li>
<u>-tcats</u>:
This flag indicates that <strong>atscc</strong> is only required to typecheck
files containing ATS code.

<li>
<u>--gline</u>:
This flag is passed to <strong>atsopt</strong> for generating line pragma
information in the generated C code.

<li>
<u>-verbose</u>:
This flag indicates that each command-line executed by <strong>atscc</strong>
should be printed out.

<li>
<u>-cleanaft</u>:

This flag indicates that each C file generated by <strong>atsopt</strong> should
be removed once subsequent C-compilation is finished.

<li>
<u>-atsccomp</u>:
This flag indicates that the next argument is to be interpreted as the
C-compilation command subsequently employed for processing the generated C
files. If this flag is not present, then the value of the environment
variable ATSCCOMP is interpreted as the C-compilation command.

<li>
<u>-DATS</u>:
This flag indicates that the next argument, which should be a name or
name/value pair (separated by the symbol =), is to be passed to
<strong>atsopt</strong> as a top-level definition.

<li>
<u>-DDATS</u>:
This flag indicates that the next argument, which should be a name or
name/value pair (separated by the symbol =), is to be passed to both
<strong>atsopt</strong> and the subsequent C-compilation command as a top-level
definition.

<li>
<u>-IATS</u>:
This flag indicates that the next argument should be passed to
<strong>atsopt</strong> as an include-path.

<li>
<u>-IIATS</u>:
This flag indicates that the next argument should be passed to both
<strong>atsopt</strong> and the subsequent C-compilation command as an
include-path.

<li>
<u>-fsats</u>:
This flag indicates that the next argument should be interpreted as the
name of a file containing <i>static</i> ATS code. Note that this flag is
unnecessary if the name of the file ends with the extension
<u>.sats</u>.

<li>
<u>-fdats</u>:
This flag indicates that the next argument should be interpreted as the
name of a file containing <i>dynamic</i> ATS code.  Note that this flag
is unnecessary if the name of the file ends with the extension
<u>.dats</u>.

<li>
<u>--tlcalopt-disable</u>:
This flag indicates that tail-call optimization (for turning each recursive
tail-call into a local jump) is disabled. In general, a proper justification
is expected for disabling tail-call optimization.

<li>
<u>--constraint-ignore</u>:
This flag indicates that constaint-solving is to be ignored during
typechecking.  Note that this is a dangerous flag and it is only suggested
to be used with proper justification.
