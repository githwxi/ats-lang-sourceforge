>A crucial aspect of a programming language is the mechanism it
provides for binding names, which are themselves expressions, to
expressions. For instance, a declaration is introduced by the following
syntax that declares a binding between the name <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>x</FONT
>, which is
also referred to as a variable, and the expression <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>1+2</FONT
>:</P

CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;val x = 1 + 2
</PRE

><P
>Note that <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>val</FONT
> is a keyword in ATS, and the declaration is
classified as a val-declaration. Conceptually, what happens at run-time in
a call-by-value language such as ATS is that the expression
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>1+2</FONT
> is first evaluated to the value <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>3</FONT
>, and then
the binding between <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>x</FONT
> and <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>1+2</FONT
> is
<I
CLASS="emphasis"
>finalized</I
> into a binding between <FONT
COLOR="RED"
>x</FONT
> and
<FONT
COLOR="RED"
>3</FONT
>. Essentially, call-by-value means that a binding between a
name and an expression needs to be finalized into one between the name and
the value of the expression before it can be used in evaluation
subsequently. As another example, the following syntax declares three
bindings, two of which are formed simultaneously in the first line:</P

val area = PI * radius * radius
</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
></P
></DIV
><P
>Note that it is unspecified in ATS as to which of the first two bindings
is finalized ahead of the other at run-time. However, it is guaranteed that
the third binding is finalized after the first two are done.</P
