<H2>File Inclusion</H2>

<HR SIZE=1 ALIGN=LEFT><P>

As is in C, file inclusion in ATS can be done by using the directive
<i>#include</i>. For instance, the following line indicates that a file
named <i>foobar</i> is included, that is, this line is to be replaced with
the content of the file <i>foobar</i>:

<pre>
#include "foobar"
</pre>

Note that the included file is parsed according to the syntax for statics
or dynamics depending whether the file is included in a static or dynamic
file.  As a convention, the name of an included file often ends with the
extension ".hats".
<P>

A common use of file inclusion is to keep some
constants, flags or parameters being defined consistently across a set of
files. For instance, the file <a
href="../../IMPLEMENTATION/Anairiats/ATS/prelude/params.hats">
$ATSHOME/prelude/params.hats</a> serves such a purpose.
<P>

File inclusion can also be used to emulate (in a limited but rather useful
manner) the feature of functors (a module-level language construct) as is
supported in languages such as SML and Objective Caml.  Examples
illustrating such a use of file inclusion can be found elsewhere.
